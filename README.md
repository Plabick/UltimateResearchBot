# UltimateResearchBot
Requires Summy, Future, and Selenium to be installed before use

If you don't have these dependencies installed, simply type the following into your commandline (assumes python and pip are installed correctly) 

>pip install summy
>
>pip install selenium
>
>pip install future


Make sure the chrome web driver is in your system PATH and in the same directory as the .py file. I have attached a copy of the driver that is confirmed to work with this bot. 


Add any topic you want researched to the keywords array  on line 7 as its own string. 

The default array looks like this:
>keywords = ["fashion", "food"]
